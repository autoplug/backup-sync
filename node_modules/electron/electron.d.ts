     * An example of registering a privileged scheme, that bypasses Content Security

     *
     * A standard scheme adheres to what RFC 3986 calls generic URI syntax. For example
     * `http` and `https` are standard schemes, while `file` is not.
     *
     * Registering a scheme as standard allows relative and absolute resources to be
     * resolved correctly when served. Otherwise the scheme will behave like the `file`
     * protocol, but without the ability to resolve relative URLs.
     *
     * For example when you load following page with custom protocol without
     * registering it as standard scheme, the image will not be loaded because
     * non-standard schemes can not recognize relative URLs:
     *
     * Registering a scheme as standard will allow access to files through the
     * FileSystem API. Otherwise the renderer will throw a security error for the
     * scheme.
     *
     * By default web storage apis (localStorage, sessionStorage, webSQL, indexedDB,
     * cookies) are disabled for non standard schemes. So in general if you want to
     * register a custom protocol to replace the `http` protocol, you have to register
     * it as a standard scheme.
     *
     * Protocols that use streams (http and stream protocols) should set `stream:
     * true`. The `<video>` and `<audio>` HTML elements expect protocols to buffer
     * their responses by default. The `stream` flag configures those elements to

     * * `socks4://foopy` - Use SOCKS v4 proxy `foopy:1080` for all URLs.
     * * `http=foopy,socks5://bar.com` - Use HTTP proxy `foopy` for http URLs, and fail
     * over to the SOCKS5 proxy `bar.com` if `foopy` is unavailable.
     * * `http=foopy,direct://` - Use HTTP proxy `foopy` for http URLs, and use no
     * proxy if `foopy` is unavailable.
     * * `http=foopy;socks=foopy2` - Use HTTP proxy `foopy` for http URLs, and use
     * `socks4://foopy2` for all other URLs.
     *
     * The `proxyBypassRules` is a comma separated list of rules described below:

     *
     * Examples: "127.0.1", "[0:0::1]", "[::1]", "http://[::1]:99"
     * * `IP_LITERAL "/" PREFIX_LENGTH_IN_BITS`
